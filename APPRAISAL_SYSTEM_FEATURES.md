#### Variance Detection
Automatically flags discrepancies between ratings:

| Variance Level | Difference | Action |
|----------------|------------|--------|
| 🟢 Low | 0-1 points | No intervention needed |

### 4. **Performance Calculation Engine**

#### Weighted Scoring Formula
```
Section Score = Σ(Question Rating × Question Weight)
Capped Score = min(Section Score, Section Max)
Base Score = Σ(All Capped Section Scores)
Final Score = Base Score + Noteworthy Bonus (up to 10%)
```

#### Performance Bands
| Band | Score Range | Typical Outcome |
|------|-------------|-----------------|
| ⭐ Exceptional | 91-100% | Top performer recognition |
| 🌟 Excellent | 81-90% | Above expectations |
